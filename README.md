Website with quizzes on all North American big 4 sports 

The teammates for this group are: Charlie Knapp and Elliot Goldman

The purpose of this code is to create a website that contains sports quizzes of all 4 major North-American sports. The quizzes will be mostly based on statistics. They will have a difficulty of easy, medium or hard. Eventually we will have accounts where users can keep track of their high scores. We will also implement a leaderboard to see who the all-time leaders are based on accuracy and time.

Our repository contains our issues and branches that segregate the different portions of our code.
